# IP-Trace-Maps

#This is a simple visualizer of WireShark logs (.pcap) using the Google Maps proprietary file-type (.kml).

#Step 1: Save logs from WireShark as .PCAP to project folder. Under main() in graph.py: change the variable ('test.pcap') to the saved file name.

#Step 2: Run the program

#Step 3: In project folder, there will be a new .kml file. Navigate to https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/ (Google My Maps), log in, and upload the file. This will show you the mapped connections from that WireShark session
